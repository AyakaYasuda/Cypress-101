- Cypress runs headless by 'npx cypress run --browser chrome'
(Add --spec "**.js" to specify the spec file)

- Cypress supports CSS selectors only

- cy.wrap() method allows you to resolve promise e.g.$el

- Cypress is asynchronous in nature and there is no guarantee in sequence of execution, but Cypress takes care of it.

- Cypress also supports Jquery methods as well as Cypress methods

- Cypress commands can't resolve promise by themselves. We need to manually resolve it by using then()
